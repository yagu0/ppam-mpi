To compile source code :

   cd build
   cmake ../src
   make

Usage :

   ppam-mpi cluster ifilename nbSeriesInChunk nbClusters randomize p_for_dissims

Where :
   ifilename = path to serialized dataset (read below)
   nbSeriesInChunk = number of time-series to process sequentially
   nbClusters = number of clusters
   randomize = 1 to dispatch time-series at random. 0 to process them in order
   p_for_dissims = the 'p' of L_p distance used to compute dissimilarities

Note : custom [de]serialization. Consider writing your own 
in src/TimeSeries/ folder if you plan to test the package.

See also src/main.c for the details.
